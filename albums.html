        </h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</dt> 
            <dd>- The album has clearly had a lasting effect upon the people around it. It pushed hip hop forward not by taking the genre in a new direction, but by taking West's best qualities – production values, sampling and combining collaborators – to new heights.</dd> <br>
            <dt>The Life of Pablo</dt> 
            <dd>- Its greatest achievement wasn't just its destruction of archetypal album conventions and willingness to take risks, but also its commitment to a visceral exploration into the mind of a flawed genius just when his year and reputation were about to get worse.</dd> <br>
            <dt>Graduation</dt>
            <dt>- Capturing the feeling of moving on up, and the changes that came with his newfound fame. “Champion” does a great job at juxtaposing his life, in the same verse he talks about shopping so much he should be Italian to a childhood related to Will Smith's Pursuit of Happiness.</dt> <br>
